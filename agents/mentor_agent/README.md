# üß† Mentor Agent - Memory-Enhanced Socratic Programming Mentor

A sophisticated Pydantic AI agent that guides junior developers through programming challenges using the Socratic method, enhanced with memory of past interactions for personalized learning experiences.

## üéØ What This Agent Does

The Mentor Agent **never gives direct answers**. Instead, it:

- **Asks leading questions** that guide students to discover solutions themselves
- **References past similar issues** from the user's learning history to reinforce patterns
- **Escalates hints progressively** through 4 levels based on confusion signals
- **Builds personalized learning paths** using temporal pattern analysis
- **Maintains encouraging, supportive tone** throughout the learning journey

### Key Innovation: Memory-Guided Socratic Teaching

Unlike traditional tutoring systems, the Mentor Agent remembers your learning journey:

- **Recent Repeats** (< 1 week): "This reminds me of your question from Tuesday..."
- **Pattern Recognition** (< 1 month): "I notice you've encountered similar challenges with async concepts..."
- **Skill Building**: "This builds on your previous array methods knowledge..."

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

## üõ†Ô∏è Features & Capabilities

### ‚úÖ Memory-Guided Socratic Questions
- References specific past issues in questions
- Builds on documented learning successes
- Connects recurring patterns across sessions
- Maintains discovery-based learning approach

### ‚úÖ Progressive Hint Escalation System

**Level 1 - Memory Probe**: "This is similar to your useState issue from last week. What approach worked then?"

**Level 2 - Pattern Recognition**: "I see a pattern with your async questions. What's the common thread?"

**Level 3 - Specific Memory Guidance**: "Remember when you discovered that React batches updates? How does that apply here?"

**Level 4 - Guided Discovery**: "Let's break this down like your previous debugging success. First, what should we check?"

### ‚úÖ Temporal Learning Classification
- **Recent Repeat** (< 1 week): Gentle reinforcement of recent discoveries
- **Pattern Recognition** (< 1 month): Connect dots between similar issues  
- **Skill Building**: Extend existing knowledge to new contexts
- **New Concept**: Standard Socratic method for unfamiliar topics

### ‚úÖ Persistent Learning Memory
- Every interaction saved with rich metadata
- ChromaDB vector search for semantic similarity
- Session tracking for hint escalation
- Learning progress analysis over time

## üéì Teaching Philosophy

### The Socratic Method Enhanced

Traditional Socratic teaching asks questions to guide discovery. The Mentor Agent enhances this with:

1. **Memory Context**: Questions reference your specific learning history
2. **Progressive Hints**: Escalates guidance based on confusion signals
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Helps you see connections across your learning journey
4. **Personalized Pace**: Adapts to your individual learning patterns

### Never Gives Direct Answers

The agent is designed to **never break the Socratic method**:

‚ùå **Wrong**: "Use `useState` with a callback function."
‚úÖ **Right**: "What happens to state updates when React batches them? Remember your discovery about timing from our session last Tuesday?"

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Optional (defaults provided)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db
CHROMA_PATH=./chroma_memory
MAX_MEMORY_RESULTS=3
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.7
HINT_ESCALATION_LEVELS=4
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from mentor_agent import MentorDependencies, mentor_settings

# Custom dependencies
deps = MentorDependencies.from_settings(
    mentor_settings,
    user_id="student123",
    max_memory_results=5,        # More memory context
    similarity_threshold=0.6,    # Broader pattern matching
    hint_escalation_levels=3     # Faster hint escalation
)
```

## üìä Usage Examples

### Example 1: New User, First Question

```python
response = await run_mentor_agent(
    "My Python loop isn't working",
    user_id="new_student"
)
# Response: "Let's think through this step by step. What do you think 
#           might be causing this behavior? What have you tried so far?"
```

### Example 2: Recent Repeat (< 1 week)

```python
# User asked about loops 3 days ago
response = await run_mentor_agent(
    "My Python loop still isn't working",
    user_id="student123"
)
# Response: "This reminds me of your loop question from Tuesday. What did 
#           you discover about the loop condition then? How might that apply here?"
```

### Example 3: Pattern Recognition (< 1 month)

```python
# User has asked 3 questions about array methods
response = await run_mentor_agent(
    "How do I filter this array?", 
    user_id="student456"
)
# Response: "I notice you've been working with array methods lately. What's the 
#           pattern you've learned with map() and forEach()? How might that apply 
#           to filtering?"
```

### Example 4: Multi-Turn Conversation

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "My React component won't re-render"},
    {"role": "mentor", "content": "What triggers a re-render in React?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "State changes?"},
    {"role": "mentor", "content": "Exactly! So what might prevent a re-render when you think state changed?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I don't know, it should work"}
]

response = await run_mentor_conversation(
    messages, 
    user_id="student789"
)
# Response: "Let's think about state mutation vs immutability. Remember your 
#           useState discoveries from last week - what did you learn about 
#           direct mutation?"
```

## üß™ Testing & Validation

**Q: Memory search returns no results**
A: Verify ChromaDB path exists and user_id consistency across sessions. Check similarity threshold settings.

**Q: Hint escalation not working**  
A: Ensure session_id persistence across conversation turns and check confusion signal detection.

**Q: Performance issues with large memory**
A: Adjust MAX_MEMORY_RESULTS and SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD. Consider ChromaDB indexing optimization.

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable detailed logging
python cli.py --debug

# Or in code

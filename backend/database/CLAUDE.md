# Database Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the database architecture and modeling documentation for the Dev Mentor AI project. The system uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with ChromaDB for vector embeddings.

## Data Modeling Approach

### Conceptual Data Model (MCD)
- **Location**: `doc/dev_mentor_ai.mcd`
- **Tool**: Mocodo for entity-relationship modeling
- **Methodology**: Merise method for French data modeling standards

### Database Implementation ‚≠ê **PRODUCTION READY**
- **Current**: `models.py` - Comprehensive PostgreSQL-only SQLAlchemy models with native UUID support
- **Operations Layer**: `../database_operations.py` - Complete CRUD operations for all entities
- **Vector Store**: `../memory_store.py` - ChromaDB integration for conversation embeddings
- **Spaced Repetition**: `../spaced_repetition.py` - SM-2 algorithm implementation

## Core Entities

### User Management ‚≠ê **IMPLEMENTED**
- **USER**: Complete user model with native PostgreSQL UUID primary keys
- **Role-based access**: Multi-role support (developer, manager, admin)
- **Authentication ready**: Password hashing and session management support

### Learning Sessions ‚≠ê **IMPLEMENTED**
- **SESSION**: Comprehensive session tracking with user relationships and agent type classification
- **INTERACTION**: Detailed message exchanges with response time tracking and vector store integration
- **Agent types**: Full support for "strict", "pydantic_strict", "curator", "flashcard" agents
- **Memory integration**: Vector ID references for ChromaDB embedding storage

### Skill Tracking System ‚≠ê **IMPLEMENTED**
- **SKILL**: Complete skill taxonomy with domain classification and relationship mapping
- **SKILL_HISTORY**: Daily snapshot system with unique constraints for spaced repetition optimization
- **REF_DOMAIN**: Comprehensive learning domain taxonomy (algorithmic, syntax, debugging, frameworks, etc.)
- **Mastery tracking**: 1-5 scale progression with confidence-based skill level calculation

### Spaced Repetition System ‚≠ê **IMPLEMENTED**
- **FLASHCARD**: Full SM-2 algorithm integration with difficulty scaling and review scheduling
- **REVIEW_SESSION**: Comprehensive performance tracking with success scores and response times
- **Algorithm implementation**: Complete SM-2 spaced repetition with ease factor calculations and interval optimization
- **Performance analytics**: Success rate tracking and learning curve analysis

### Reference Data System ‚≠ê **IMPLEMENTED**
- **REF_LANGUAGE**: Complete programming language taxonomy with category classification
- **REF_INTENT**: Interaction type classification for learning analytics
- **REF_DOMAIN**: Skill domain categorization with display ordering and status management
- **Data integrity**: Foreign key constraints and referential integrity throughout all tables

## Design Decisions

### Vector Memory Integration
**Choice**: Keep ChromaDB external to relational model
- **Rationale**: Simpler prototyping, optimized performance
- **Implementation**: `vector_id` field links interactions to embeddings
- **Future**: Potential migration to pgvector for scale

### Skill Tracking Granularity
**Choice**: Daily snapshots via SKILL_HISTORY
- **Rationale**: Enables fine-grained progress tracking
- **Use case**: Spaced repetition algorithm optimization
- **Gamification**: Detailed progress visualization

### Reference Tables Strategy
**Choice**: Controlled vocabularies over ENUMs
- **Rationale**: Data consistency and UI standardization
- **Benefits**: Analytics reliability, easy extension
- **Example**: REF_LANGUAGE prevents "JavaScript" vs "javascript" inconsistencies

## Domain Classification

### Learning Domains (REF_DOMAIN)
- **ALGORITHMIC**: Data structures, complexity, optimization
- **SYNTAX**: Language syntax mastery
- **LOGIC**: Programming logic, control structures
- **ARCHITECTURE**: Design patterns, code organization
- **DEBUGGING**: Error resolution, testing, troubleshooting
- **FRAMEWORKS**: React, Angular, Spring, etc.
- **DATABASES**: SQL, NoSQL, data modeling
- **DEVOPS**: Deployment, CI/CD, containerization
- **SECURITY**: Application security, authentication
- **PERFORMANCE**: Optimization, monitoring, scaling

## Mocodo Usage

### Generate SVG Diagram
```bash
# Install Mocodo
pip install mocodo

# Generate diagram from MCD file
mocodo database/doc/dev_mentor_ai.mcd
```

### MCD Syntax Reference
- **Entities**: `ENTITY: attribute1, attribute2, ...`
- **Relationships**: `RELATION, CardinalityA EntityA, CardinalityB EntityB`
- **Association attributes**: Listed after the colon in relationships
- **Cardinalities**: `0N` (zero to many), `1N` (one to many), `11` (one to one), `01` (zero to one)
